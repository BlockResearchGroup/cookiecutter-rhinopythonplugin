# Rhino PythonPlugIn Template

This project automates the set up of a new python-based PlugIn for Rhino using an opinionated Cookiecutter template.

[Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#)
is a command-line utility that lets you quickly bootstrap a new project from a template.
It takes a directory tree and copies it into your new project,
replacing all the generic info that finds surrounded by templating tags `{{` and `}}` with your project info written in `cookiecutter.json`.
